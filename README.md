## A mix of Sonokai and Monokai because I liked Sonokai from sainnhe

How to install

- If you dont thave a colorschemes directory yet do
```
mkdir ~/.config/micro/colorschemes
```
- Download the sonokai.micro file and put it in that colorschemes directory
- Open micro and bring up the command bar with ctrl-e
- type the command
```
set colorscheme sonokai
```

ALSO IMPORTANT
- you need to add this line in your .bashrc file to get the full colors

```
export MICRO_TRUECOLOR=1
```
- and possibly this line too not sure

```
export COLORTERM=truecolor
```


- should be all set from there
